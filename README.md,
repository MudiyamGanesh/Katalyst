# Katalyst üß†‚ú®

> Beyond the Prompt: An intelligent workspace that reimagines human-AI collaboration.

**Katalyst** is a full-stack, AI-powered creative workspace currently in development. It's designed to solve the "digital janitor" work of managing research and inspiration, freeing creative professionals to focus on discovery and creation.

It's not just another note-taking app. Katalyst acts as an intelligent assistant that automatically captures, analyzes, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äî**connects** your ideas from across the web.

* **AI Automation:** Automatically summarizes content, applies intelligent tags, and extracts key insights.
* **Proactive Discovery:** A visual, interactive canvas that automatically surfaces and displays hidden connections between your saved items.
* **Collaborative Workspaces:** Real-time shared environments for teams to build a collective "brain."
* **Multi-Modal Knowledge:** Intelligently processes web articles, YouTube transcripts, and GitHub repositories.
